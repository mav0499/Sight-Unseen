POE initiative

We have seen the Bitcoin Blockchain POC confirm and validate transactions by virtue of Proof of Work model. This creates transfer of value (and data) with a near nil possibility of default. As the world attempts to satisfy other asset types i.e. assets more tangible and tied to physical property, DLT has taken a lead over initiatives such as colored coins transported over the bitcoin (or some other) network.
