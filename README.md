POE initiative

The Bitcoin Blockchain POC confirms and validates transactions by virtue of a Proof of Work model. This creates transfer of value (and data) with a near nil possibility of default and repudiation. As the world attempts to satisfy other asset types i.e. assets more tangible and tied to physical property, DLT has taken a lead over initiatives such as "colored coins across the bitcoin (or some other) network".
