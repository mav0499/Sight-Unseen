POE initiative

The Bitcoin Blockchain POC confirms and validates transactions by virtue of a Proof of Work model. This creates transfer of value (and data) with a near nil possibility of default and repudiation. As the world attempts to satisfy other asset types i.e. assets more tangible and tied to physical property, DLT has taken the lead over initiatives such as "colored coins across the bitcoin (or some other) blockchain". This creates a litany of new challenges - data and value transport using an alternate consensus protocol, contract and payment in a DLT ecosystem where the value is conveyed via the DL but the counter value is conveyed in the real world; user identification and authentication; and asset proof of existence. One may posit that the proof mechanism constructed in the bitcoin architecture is solely to prevent the replication of payments (computer files) by a "bad user". Because computer files are very simple to recreate, ergo the challenge facing both decentralized and distributed networks remains fraud and misrepresentation. It may be argued that these mechanisms will exacerbate cyber crime while stream lining back office processing.
